#Filtering results

In SQL, the WHERE keyword allows you to filter based on both text and numeric values in a table. There are a few different comparison operators you can use:

= equal
<> not equal
< less than
> greater than
<= less than or equal to
>= greater than or equal to
For example, you can filter text records such as title. The following code returns all films with the title 'Metropolis':

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE title = 'Metropolis';
Notice that the WHERE clause always comes after the FROM statement!

Select release_year from films where budget < 50000 
Select * from films where release_year = 2016
Get the title and release year of films released after 2000.
Select title, release_year from films where release_year > 2000

Select distinct budget from films where release_year < 2000

Simple filtering of text
Remember, the WHERE clause can also be used to filter text results, such as names or countries.

For example, this query gets the titles of all films which were filmed in China:

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE country = 'China';
Now it's your turn to practice using WHERE with text values!

Get all details for all French language films.
Select * from films where language = 'French'
Get the name and birth date of the person born on November 11th, 1974. Remember to use ISO date format ('1974-11-11')!
select name, birthdate from people where birthdate = '1974-11-11'

Get the number of Hindi language films.
select count(language) from films where language = 'Hindi'

Get all details for all films with an R certification.
Select * from films where certification = 'R'

Get the title and release year for all Spanish language films released before 2000.
select title, release_year from films where release_year < 2000 and language = 'Spanish'

Get all details for Spanish language films released after 2000, but before 2010.
select * from films where release_year > 2000 and release_year < 2010

## WHERE AND OR
What if you want to select rows based on multiple conditions where some but not all of the conditions need to be met? For this, SQL has the OR operator.

For example, the following returns all films released in either 1994 or 2000:

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year = 1994
OR release_year = 2000;
Note that you need to specify the column for every OR condition, so the following is invalid:

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year = 1994 OR 2000;
When combining AND and OR, be sure to enclose the individual clauses in parentheses, like so:

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE (release_year = 1994 OR release_year = 1995)
AND (certification = 'PG' OR certification = 'R');
###

Now you'll write a query to get the title and release year of films released in the 90s which were in French or Spanish and which took in more than $2M gross.

It looks like a lot, but you can build the query up one step at a time to get comfortable with the underlying concept in each step. Let's go!

select title, release_year 
from films 
where release_year >= 1990 and release_year < 2000 
and (language = 'French' OR language = 'Spanish')
and gross > 2000000
